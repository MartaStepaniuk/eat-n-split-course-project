# Eat-'N-Split Project

[Project](https://eat-n-split-project.netlify.app/) developed as part of the course ["The Ultimate React Course 2023: React, Redux & More"](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/) together with instructor [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/).

Doing this project I put into practice everything I learned (components, props, JSX, useState and state management).
